contracts and webapp

when you clone the project, it create clone two folder
contracts/
webapp/

the contracts is a foundry made project
the webapp is made from next js

to setup the contratcs, `cd ./contracts` the run the foundy install
also move out and back to the webapp and run the npm install

to install everything and then start the application, if there are any issues, create an issue on the github and it will be looked at.

This repo contain a POC for an idea i dreamt off.
